## SUMMARY

Three years ago I completed my first Junior Front-End Developer course. I was very curious how I would feel in this new area.
For the next year, I was perfecting new technologies learned during the course. During this time, I was also improving my English.

2020 was a time to refresh knowledge and improve skills at RS School. At that time, I completed the English version of the course. I also decided to take part in the Belarusian version, where I performed a team task. It was a very good experience in the field of language communication with the Russian-speaking team and in the area of working on the RS School application.

## EXPERIENCE

* During the Junior Front-End Developer course at InfoShare, for half a year I did practical exercises in a group of 4 (Scrum). We created a single page project, first in html-css-js technology, then its version in React.

* In 2020, I worked in a group of 5 while participating in the React course at Rolling Scopes School (Belarus version). Our task was to work on the new version of the "Schedule" module in the RS School application. The task was completed and presented.

* Independent work at home.
