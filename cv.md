## SUMMARY
> *(your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).*

## SKILLS

- GIT
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Java Script
- React

## CODE EXAMPLES 

> *(LATEST)*

## EXPERIENCE

> *(for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)*

**Level: A2-B1**

I listen to BBC radio every day where possible.
Two years ago I started learning front-end and since then I have often read texts in this language.
Last year, for six months, I attended meetings with a native speaker ([Talkersi School](https://talkersi.pl/)) to improve my conversation skills.
I am currently improving my skills in the online [e-tutor](https://www.etutor.pl/) course.
