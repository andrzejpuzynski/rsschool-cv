## SUMMARY

Three years ago I signed up for the Junior Front-End Developer course. I was driven by a desire to develop professionally and change the job of a graphic designer for a www programmer. I was very curious how I would feel in this area.

A lot of new knowledge acquired during the course worked well for me. I decided to continue my change.

After the course, I improved my English for six months, practiced JavaScript Codewars everyday and practically created websites.
At the same time, there were a lot of jobs in my current job graphic and earning opportunities, which reduced my involvement in the programming field.

I welcomed the RS School course with the joy of returning to the change. My goal is to get a job as a Front-End Developer and to develop in this field while working.

## EXPERIENCE

* During the Junior Front-End Developer course at InfoShare, for half a year I did practical exercises in a group of 4 (Scrum). We created a single page project, first in html-css-js technology, then its version in React.

* My recent experience is independent work at home.

Two years ago I started learning front-end and since then I have often read texts in this language.
